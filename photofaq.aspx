    whatever.Photographs published on the site are not used anywhere else for any 
    other purpose. your photograph does not affect your privacy at all, so long as

    This is very important.There are several things you should keep in mind while 
    choosing your photograph.Choose solo snap in which your face is clearly 
    visible.Avoid publishing a group photograph because it encourages comparisons 
    which may not allow be to your advantage.A profesionally clicked photograph is 
    always better than one you&#39;ve clicked at random.Professionals know how to adjust 
    the angle and lighting to make you look your best.So even if you&nbsp; have to 
    get one clicked just for this purpose,it&#39;s well worth the effort.<br />

    beholder.Only good things can come from adding your photograph 
    online.Firstly,anyone who corresponds with you has already seen your 
    photograph.So you can rest assured that looks will not be a hindrance.And 
    secondly,anyone who doesn&#39;t correspond with you after seeing the photograph well 
    obviously you don&#39;t want a spouse like that do you?So,adding your photograph 
    greatly increases the chances of you finding the &#39;right&#39; person faster!<br />
