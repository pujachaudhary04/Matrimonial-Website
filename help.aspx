    This is very important.There are several things you should keep in mind while 
    choosing your photograph.Choose solo snap in which your face is clearly 
    visible.Avoid publishing a group photograph because it encourages comparisons 
    which may not allow be to your advantage.A profesionally clicked photograph is 
    always better than one you&#39;ve clicked at random.Professionals know how to adjust 
    the angle and lighting to make you look your best.So even if you&nbsp; have to 
    get one clicked just for this purpose,it&#39;s well worth the effort.<br />

    beholder.Only good things can come from adding your photograph 
    online.Firstly,anyone who corresponds with you has already seen your 
    photograph.So you can rest assured that looks will not be a hindrance.And 
    secondly,anyone who doesn&#39;t correspond with you after seeing the photograph well 
    obviously you don&#39;t want a spouse like that do you?So,adding your photograph 
    greatly increases the chances of you finding the &#39;right&#39; person faster!<br />
